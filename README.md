## üåü Project Overview

Make My Events is a dynamic web platform built to bridge the gap between people planning events and the professionals who can bring them to life. In a crowded market, finding the right event planner can be challenging. This application provides a centralized, easy-to-navigate directory where users can filter companies by category and search for specific services.

For event management professionals, it offers a user-friendly interface to create, update, and manage their business listings, giving them visibility to a targeted audience. The entire application is built with a secure authentication system, ensuring that user data and listings are protected.

* **User-Managed Listings (CRUD):** Authenticated users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own company listings through a dedicated "My Listings" dashboard.
* **Protected Routes:** Users must be logged in to contact organizers or manage listings, ensuring secure interactions.
* **Interactive UI:** A responsive and modern user interface built with React, featuring professional loading states, a dynamic navbar, and toast notifications for user feedback.
